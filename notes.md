## Notes for future projects

## The language may look unprofessional because they were written just to remember a concept, not present them as a finished product

### project ideas:

- Song Savvy:
  An app in which you create a catalogue of songs/albums/mixtapes that you've listened to and you want to listen to.
  You can organize them in your own categories or pre-made categories.
  Also, you can select a random item to which you can listen, being able to filter off listened/unlistened ones.
  After marking an item as listened to, you have the option to leave a review and rating
  Create a graph visualization system based on tags that puts each item on a map based on how "close" it is to other items.
  You can also make the app import or sync data from other services or apps(spotify, phone music library) to keep your library up to date
- Looper pedal app
- HeadlinesHub:
  You get the news from all possible sources and put them side to side on specific topics to see all view angles. In the future, maybe create sorting for region and language and let the user choose languages and regions. Extremely relevant and/or important news transcend filters though.
- App like Transcribe! but for mobile
- Flower generator:
  An AI powered generator of flower photos with adjustable parameters for all moms to send to each other
- Pixel art animation tool:
  Create tool for pixel art animations that takes a texture and maps it to an animation, something like this: https://youtu.be/HsOKwUwL1bE
- Book to visual novel:
  The resultant visual novel would follow all the conventions of anime visual novels. The pictures would be AI generated. If there are characters in the book, they would be represented as anime characters in the images, and if the book is educational or other type of non-fiction, there would be an anime girl representation of the author or a random anime girl relating the text.
- Money manager:
  An application where you enter how much money you have and can add or subtract from your balance. The funds can be stored in different currencies. Similarly, you can add people to whom you owe money or who owe you money, and if debts are settled, the amount of money you have automatically changes.
