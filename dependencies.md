# Packages and dependencies for my system

There is definetly a way easier and more automated way of doing this, but this will do for now ðŸ˜…

This is a list of all the external packages that I install on my system after a fresh install, so that I don't have to remember them. It's by far not a comprehensive list.

The reason why I don't use ansible or some other similar tool is because I am currently hopping from distro to distro and, to my knowledge, there is no comprehensive way to just install all of them automatically
